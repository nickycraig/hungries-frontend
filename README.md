# Hungry Guys Recipe File

My group of friend, aka the Hungry Guys, loves to get together for dinner and playing (mind) games. I wanted to make a recipe file, so we could have a centralized place for us to share recipes with each other. I'm always googling recipes and then trying to find them again a few months later when I think about making that dish again. This recipe file is a place where any Hungry Guy can come enter a recipe they've found and liked, and it also serves as a way to store that link to a recipe on the web, so you won't have trouble finding it again.

## Contribution Guidelines

In the future, user login/auth would be desired feature, as well as any improvements to the look and styling of the app. It would also be helpful to have a way for the database of recipes to be searchable by keywords, maybe a main ingredient, or type of cuisine, or dietary restrictions like vegan or gluten-free.
